## Taxes

Today was a big day for the country. Rachel Reeves unleashed her devastating tax rises, and the early analysis is just about as damning as you could expect. That being the case, I might have to join an angry simpson's mob of pitch fork and burning torch wielding citizens to overthrow the government, but in the UK we just call that a week day. 

## Learning

After staring an a skeleton html file for a few hours, I finally managed to add a `<div>`, and from there I actually made a start on a landing page. Starting seems to be the hardest part. The standard of websites these days is truly excellent, and trying my best to make something that didn't look completely amateurish has been a challenge. The purpose of all this is learn, and towards that end I've been successful.

## TailwindCSS

Tailwindcss is making me happy. Now I'm over the initial hump, I'm getting a feel for it. With the instant feedback loop you can get with front end, it really is just a matter of add a utility class, see what it does, maybe look at the docs or ask an LLM, and just iterate until you're happy. I think I'd like to learn more about colour schemes, and define my own nice colours to use, beyond the pre-packaged ones, but that's something for later.

### Jazz

Background noise can be useful. I always hated it in the offices I used to work in because it usually came in the form of one person basically shouting the whole day, narrating their life in an orgy of narcissistic self-absorbed ego. Well, a bit of smooth jazz from a free online station gave me just the vibe I needed to quiet my mind and fall into a few hours of productive work. Now I work from home, for myself, I'm swiftly running out of other things to do as procrastination. I still need to get round to booking an MOT and write a will, but I can kick that can down the road for another few days.
